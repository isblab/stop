### Data
`paper_example_figures` and `paper_imp_figures` contain the figures used in the paper.
All the scripts necessary for generating the figures are in `scripts`. To generate the example data, first run StOP (`python main.py <input file>`) on all the param files in `examples/example_1` and `2` and then run the scripts in the `scripts` folder.
The data necessary for plotting is already currently present in the `examples` folder.

The data for the IMP_systems is available via the zenodo (link)
